# Shape Calculator in Java

This Java program demonstrates object-oriented programming principles using an abstract class `Shape` and its concrete subclasses `Rectangle` and `Circle`. It allows users to input dimensions and then calculates the area and perimeter of the shapes.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Shape.java`: Abstract class defining common structure for shapes.
- `Rectangle.java`: Subclass implementing area and perimeter for rectangles.
- `Circle.java`: Subclass implementing area and perimeter for circles.
- `Main.java`: Driver class to take user input and display results.

## 📌 Features

- Abstract methods for calculating area and perimeter
- Constructor overloading
- Inheritance and method overriding
- User input via `Scanner`
- Polymorphism using abstract class references

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Compile all `.java` files:

   ```bash
   javac *.java
